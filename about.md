### intro.

I never wrote a line of code until college. Coming from a family where everyone was expected to take up commerce, 
that‚Äôs exactly what I was supposed to do too. But then it hit me‚ÄîI really didn't want to pursue any of the subjects I‚Äôd studied so far as a career. 
So, naturally, I did the only logical thing: _Inky pinky ponky'd_ my career over to computers and coding ‚Äîseriously, no kidding. I enrolled in 
whichever college would take a commerce kid with zero coding experience and thus began my adventure! 

Oh I love cats üêà _kitty kitty kitty_ and ofcourse I am allergic to them, but that has never stopped me from expressing my love.

### what I do

I work as a Software Engineer, focused mostly on the backend. I have done everything from designing the architecture, APIs, DB to developing them, then deploying
and maintaing it _perks of being in a startup_. One of the most cool projects I have worked on was do with multi-tenancy and making it scalable on a monolith. I am 
also learning Golang now, because why not? :)

### where I'm at now

I live in Bangalore, a city with such a vibrant tech culture that it's practically buzzing with code. When I first arrived, it didn't take long 
to realize one thing: I was going to be here for a _very_ long time. :)
